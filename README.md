# The Kings Challenge

This is a very simple task to develop a small program that will fetch a list of English monarchs from an online data source and provide various statistics about them.

## Questions

The program will answer these questions:

1. How many monarchs are there in the list?
2. Which monarch ruled the longest (and for how long)?
3. Which house ruled the longest (and for how long)?
4. What was the most common first name?

Apparently big companies look at stuff like this.
